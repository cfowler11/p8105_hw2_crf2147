# Problem 1

``` r
#reading in relevant data from sheet 1
trash_wheel = 
  read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                         sheet = 'Mr. Trash Wheel',
                         range = "A2:N338") %>% 
  #creating better variable names

  #drop rows with na in dumpster
  drop_na(dumpster)

#reading in 2017 data
precip_2017 =
  read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                         sheet = '2017 Precipitation',

  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na('month') %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017)

#reading in 2018 data
precip_2018 =
  read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                         sheet = '2018 Precipitation',
                         range = "A2:B15") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na('month','total') %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)
```

``` r
#combining 2017 and 2018 data
precipitation = 
  bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018) %>% 
  mutate(month = factor(month, labels=c(month.name))) 
```

The Mr. Trash Wheel data has 286 observations, while the precipiation
data from 2017 and 2018 has 24 observations. Mr. Trash Wheel provides
information on the `dumpster`, `month`, and `year` of the trash
collection, as well as information on the quantity and content of the
trash. The precipitation data only includes information on the `month`,
`year`, and `precipitation` total. In 2018, the total precipitation
recorded was 70.33. The median number of sports balls per dumster in
2017 was 8.

# Problem 2

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the
variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day;

replace month number with month name;

create a president variable taking values gop and dem,

remove prez\_dem and prez\_gop; and remove the day variable

``` r
#reading and cleaning pols_month
pols_month = 
  read_csv("data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>% 
  mutate(month = factor(month, labels=c(month.name))) %>% 
  mutate(president = ifelse(prez_gop == 1, "republican", "democrat")) %>% 
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above.
For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month,
and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

``` r
#reading in and cleaning snp data
snp = 
  read_csv("data/snp.csv") %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year")) %>% 
  arrange(month) %>% 
  mutate(month = factor(month, labels=c(month.name))) %>% 
  select(year, month, close) %>% 
  arrange(year, month)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the previous
datasets: switching from “wide” to “long” format; ensuring that key
variables have the same name; ensuring that key variables take the same
values.

``` r
#reading in and cleaning unemployment data
unemployment = 
  read_csv("data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  rename(year = Year, January = Jan, February = Feb, March = Mar, April = Apr, June = Jun, July = Jul, August = Aug, September = Sep, October = Oct, November = Nov, December = Dec) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
   January:December,
   names_to = "month",
   values_to = "unemployment"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(year = factor(year))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

``` r
#merging snp and pols_month
data_538 = 
  left_join(pols_month, snp, by= c('year','month'))

#merging data_538 and unemployment
data_538 = 
  left_join(data_538, unemployment, by= c('year','month'))
```

    ## Warning: Column `year` joining character vector and factor, coercing into
    ## character vector

    ## Warning: Column `month` joining factor and character vector, coercing into
    ## character vector

First, the `pols-month` dataset contains information by date about the
United States government’s distribution between democrats and
republicans in the House, Senate, and the president. Next, the `snp`
dataset gives information by date on the S\&P stock market value.
Lastly, the `unemployment` dataset gives information by month and year
on the percentage of unemployed individuals in the country. Together,
merged into `data_538`, we have a 822 rows by 11columns dataset with
information from 1947 to 2015. This dataset has information organized by
`year` and `month` about the distribution of democrats and republicans
in the Senate and the House, the party of the president (`president`),
the close value of the S\&P stock price (`close`), and the unemployment
rate (`unemployment`).

# Problem 3

Load and tidy the data. Note that, although these data may seem fairly
well formatted initially, the names of a categorical predictor and the
case structure of string variables- names - changed over time; you’ll
need to address this in your data cleaning. Also, some rows seem
duplicated, and these will need to be removed (hint: google something
like “dplyr remove duplicate rows” to get started).

``` r
#reading in and cleaning baby names data
popular_baby_names = 
  read_csv("data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER", "ASIAN AND PACI"),
    ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "BLACK NON HISPANIC", "BLACK NON HISP"),
    ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "WHITE NON HISPANIC", "WHITE NON HISP"),
    childs_first_name = str_to_lower(childs_first_name),
    ethnicity = str_to_lower(ethnicity)
    ) %>% 
  distinct()
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   `Year of Birth` = col_double(),
    ##   Gender = col_character(),
    ##   Ethnicity = col_character(),
    ##   `Child's First Name` = col_character(),
    ##   Count = col_double(),
    ##   Rank = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
olivia_table = popular_baby_names %>% 
  filter(childs_first_name == 'olivia') %>% 
  select (year_of_birth, ethnicity, rank) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year_of_birth,
    values_from = rank
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "asian and paci", "Asian and Pacific Islander"),
    ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "black non hisp", "Black and Non Hispanic"),
    ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "white non hisp", "White and Non Hispanic")
  ) %>% 
  rename(Ethnicity = ethnicity)
