\#Problem 1

``` r
#reading in relevant data from sheet 1
trash_wheel = 
  read_excel("data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
                         sheet = 'Mr. Trash Wheel',
                         range = "A2:N338") %>% 
  #creating better variable names
  janitor::clean_names() %>%  
  #drop rows with na in dumpster
  drop_na(dumpster)

#reading in 2017 data
precip_2017 =
  read_excel("data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
                         sheet = '2017 Precipitation',
                         range = "A2:B15") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na('month') %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017)

#reading in 2018 data
precip_2018 =
  read_excel("data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
                         sheet = '2018 Precipitation',
                         range = "A2:B15") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na('month','total') %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)
```

``` r
#combining 2017 and 2018 data
precipitation = 
  bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018) %>% 
  mutate(month = factor(month, labels=c(month.name))) 
```

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in both resulting datasets,
and give examples of key variables. For available data, what was the
total precipitation in 2018? What was the median number of sports balls
in a dumpster in 2017?

The Mr. Trash Wheel data has 285 observations, while the precipiation
data from 2017 and 2018 has 19 observations. Mr. Trash Wheel provides
information on the `dumpster`, `month`, and `year` of the trash
collection, as well as information on the quantity and content of the
trash. The precipitation data only includes information on the `month`,
`year`, and `precipitation` total.

In 2018, the total precipitation recorded was 23.5.

The median number of sports balls per dumster in 2017 was 8.

\#Problem 2

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the
variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day;

replace month number with month name;

create a president variable taking values gop and dem,

remove prez\_dem and prez\_gop; and remove the day variable

``` r
#reading and cleaning pols_month
pols_month = 
  read_csv("data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>% 
  mutate(month = factor(month, labels=c(month.name))) %>% 
  mutate(president = ifelse(prez_gop == 1, "republican", "democrat")) %>% 
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above.
For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month,
and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

``` r
#reading in and cleaning snp data
snp = 
  read_csv("data/snp.csv") %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year")) %>% 
  arrange(month) %>% 
  mutate(month = factor(month, labels=c(month.name))) %>% 
  select(year, month, close) %>% 
  arrange(year, month)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the previous
datasets: switching from “wide” to “long” format; ensuring that key
variables have the same name; ensuring that key variables take the same
values.

``` r
#reading in and cleaning unemployment data
unemployment = 
  read_csv("data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  rename(year = Year, January = Jan, February = Feb, March = Mar, April = Apr, June = Jun, July = Jul, August = Aug, September = Sep, October = Oct, November = Nov, December = Dec) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
   January:December,
   names_to = "month",
   values_to = "unemployment"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(year = factor(year))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

``` r
#merging snp and pols_month
data_538 = 
  left_join(pols_month, snp, by= c('year','month'))

#merging data_538 and unemployment
data_538 = 
  left_join(data_538, unemployment, by= c('year','month'))
```

    ## Warning: Column `year` joining character vector and factor, coercing into
    ## character vector

    ## Warning: Column `month` joining factor and character vector, coercing into
    ## character vector

\#Problem 3

Load and tidy the data. Note that, although these data may seem fairly
well formatted initially, the names of a categorical predictor and the
case structure of string variables- names - changed over time; you’ll
need to address this in your data cleaning. Also, some rows seem
duplicated, and these will need to be removed (hint: google something
like “dplyr remove duplicate rows” to get started).

``` r
popular_baby_names = 
  read_csv("data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   `Year of Birth` = col_double(),
    ##   Gender = col_character(),
    ##   Ethnicity = col_character(),
    ##   `Child's First Name` = col_character(),
    ##   Count = col_double(),
    ##   Rank = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
table(popular_baby_names$Ethnicity)
```

    ## 
    ##             ASIAN AND PACI ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER 
    ##                        693                       2693 
    ##             BLACK NON HISP         BLACK NON HISPANIC 
    ##                        681                       2826 
    ##                   HISPANIC             WHITE NON HISP 
    ##                       5714                       1338 
    ##         WHITE NON HISPANIC 
    ##                       5473
